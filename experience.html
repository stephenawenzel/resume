                    <li class="col-12 col-sm-12">I investigated mitochondrial movement along acetylated and de-acetylated microtubules in fruit fly stem cells. I designed and completed experiments with the research team using fluorescein microscopy and image analysis using the R programming language. I captured kymographs of mitochondrial movement, tracking displacement to determine velocity and acceleration in response to cancer drug therapies. I reviewed scientific literature to gather relevant information to inform experimental hypotheses and design. I presented findings at the 2021 Fall Undergraduate Research Expo.</li>
